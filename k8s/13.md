The different content of the files in the containers is caused by them being independent entities and only the LoadBalancer is deciding where the end-user will end up in and leave a trail. Thus records are distributed relatively uniformly across all volumes.

## Parralel launch

All container are self-sufficient apps, thus there is noe incentive to launch pods in a particular order.
Which could be accomplished via `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` parameter.
