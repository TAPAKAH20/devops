## Flask selection

Easy to start and relatively lightweight framework,
minor amount of expierence with it.

Actually used practises are all from python list (to varing degrees),
and nothing from flask specific ones.

## Python best practices found

1. Creating `requirements.txt` file
2. Using a linter
3. Creating function documentation
4. PEP8 style
5. Correcting broken code immediately
6. Using virtual environments
7. Code repo and version control
8. Python Zen
9. Object-oriented approach
10. Write readable code

## Flask specific best practises

1. Breaking project into simple packages
2. Using app factories and `current_app` function
3. Extracting configuration into separate .yaml files
4. Use `celery` for task queue

### Linters used

* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for python
* [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) for markdown
* [Haskell Dockerfile Linter](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) for Dockerfile
